/**
 * This file imports configuration objects from either the config.dev.js file
 * or the config.prod.js file depending on whether we are in __DEV__ or not.
 *
 * Note that we do not gitignore these files. Unlike on web servers, just because
 * these are not checked into your repo doesn't mean that they are secure.
 * In fact, you're shipping a JavaScript bundle with every
 * config variable in plain text. Anyone who downloads your app can easily
 * extract them.
 *
 * If you doubt this, just bundle your app, and then go look at the bundle and
 * search it for one of your config variable values. You'll find it there.
